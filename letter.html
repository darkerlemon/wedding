           <p>He thought he would just have another day that was not different than any other one. Same old, usual, boring day. The day so usual that makes you think of the meaning of it all. But something he could never have guessed happened that day instead. Something marvelous and magical, something impossible in his eyes. 
            <br><br>He never believed in anything beyond the limits of science. He didn’t believe in gods, religions, horoscopes, or fortune telling. But something was about to change everything he believed in.
            <br><br>An elven princess who is as bright as the sun and as beautiful as the most colorful flowers. She was the kindest and had the most charming smile. She was out of this world and was the best thing that could ever happen to him. <p>

            <p>Everything changed for our guy when he met her. The world wasn’t so hostile anymore. Birds were singing, the sun was shining, and the colors were brighter than ever. He could never believe meeting an elven princess as he always thought they were just the characters from our imagination. But there she was with all her beauty and glory - the most amazing gift from the universe.
        </p><br><p>He is now the happiest man in the world whenever he is with his elven queen. Missing her every second he is not with her. He could not bear to see anything bad happening to her and would protect her no matter the cost, even if that cost is massacring some younglings in an old temple.</p>
            
          <br><br><p>They are calling everyone from all the multiverses to celebrate their good fortune and happiness. Nothing can stop them on their mission to spread the love they have. Especially not an old, rotten, cult who thinks they are above the law.<p>
